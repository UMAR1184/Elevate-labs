# Enhanced Chatbot Requirements
# No external dependencies required - uses only Python standard library
# 
# Standard library modules used:
# - random (for response variation)
# - re (for pattern matching)
# - json (for conversation saving)
# - datetime (for timestamps)
# - typing (for type hints)

# Optional: For future enhancements, you might consider:
# nltk>=3.8          # For advanced natural language processing
# textblob>=0.17     # For sentiment analysis
# spacy>=3.4         # For named entity recognition
# requests>=2.28     # For API integrations (weather, news, etc.)
